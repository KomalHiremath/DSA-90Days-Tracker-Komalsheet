# DSA-90Days-Tracker-Komalsheet

Hi! I'm Komal Hiremath, and this repository is dedicated to my 90-day Data Structures & Algorithms journey, following the [Striverâ€™s A2Z DSA Sheet]

ðŸŽ¯MY GOAL

To master DSA in 90 days and crack a software development job with a package of 4â€“6 LPA by the end of July 2025.

I'm also aiming to grow this foundation to reach a **20 LPA+ role within 3 months** through focused practice, interview prep, and consistent upskilling.
